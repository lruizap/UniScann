# UniScann

This repository hosts an experimental project aimed at **scanning and differentiating between various types of codes**, such as **barcodes** and **DataMatrix codes**, with the goal of extracting meaningful data from them.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The main idea is to build a system capable of:

- Detecting codes from images or streams (e.g., camera input).
- Distinguishing between **barcodes** and **DataMatrix** codes.
- Extracting and parsing the encoded data.

At this stage, the project is primarily a **sandbox for experiments and research**, where different approaches, tools, and algorithms will be tested.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is currently in an **early exploratory phase**:

- The final scope is not yet defined.
- Features and direction may change as development and research progress.
- Expect breaking changes, incomplete implementations, or placeholder code.

## üß™ Goals (Work in Progress)

- [ ] Explore libraries and frameworks for code detection.
- [ ] Implement basic differentiation between barcode types.
- [ ] Develop a prototype scanner that supports multiple input sources (images, webcam, etc.).
- [ ] Test data extraction and integration with potential applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Subject to Change)

The project is still under research, but possible technologies and languages include:

- **Python** (for prototyping and quick testing)
- **OpenCV** (image processing and computer vision)
- **Zxing / Pyzbar** (barcode and DataMatrix scanning libraries)
- Other tools/libraries depending on experiments

## üìå Next Steps

- Continue researching reliable detection methods.
- Build small prototypes for reading both barcodes and DataMatrix.
- Evaluate performance and potential real-world applications.
